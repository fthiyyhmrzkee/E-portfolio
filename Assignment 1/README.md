# Reflection 1
## INDUSTRIAL VISIT 1 - Visit to New Academia Learning Innovation (NALI 2023) on 7th and 8th November 2023
### At the end of this assignment, I gained a lot of positive input starting from NALI visit then did the report. From the visit, I can conclude that there are a variety of methods of providing innovative teaching and learning practices for students. I also agreed that teaching and learning nowadays must be creative and enjoyable so that learners do not get bored easily in learning. I also got a chance to gain new knowledge during the interview session. I interviewed one of lecturers in our faculty, Ms. Rashidah. She explained clearly and concisely about her poster on that day, and it was interesting and caught my eye as her idea in making the learning and teaching to become enjoyable really accepted. The process of interviewing was smooth, and this process helped me to boost my confidence to have conversation with someone. Other than that, I really enjoyed the process of making the report with my group members. We divided the task equally so that all of us could do the report.
