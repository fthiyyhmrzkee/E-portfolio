ASSIGNMENT 1
At the end of this assignment, I received a lot of positive input, beginning with the NALI visit and continuing with the report. 
From the visit, I can conclude that there are a variety of methods of providing innovative teaching and learning practices for students. 
I also agreed that teaching and learning nowadays must be creative and enjoyable so that learners do not get bored easily in learning. 
I also had the opportunity to learn new things during the interview session. I interviewed one of lecturers in our faculty, Ms. Rashidah. 
She explained clearly and concisely about her poster on that day, and it was engaging and caught my eye as her idea in making the learning and teaching to become enjoyable was widely accepted.
The process of interviewing went smoothly, and it helped me boost my confidence in having conversation with someone. Other than that, I really enjoyed the process of making the report with my group members. 
We divided the task equally so that all of us could do the report.
