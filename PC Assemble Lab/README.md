# PC Assemble Lab
## Reflection 5
### The PC assembly lab was enjoyable yet challenging as this was the first time my groupmates and I handled PC components. Reflecting on the experience, we gained new knowledge and skills throughout the lab session. Before starting the assembly process, we must listen to the instructions from the assistant so that we do not miss what should be done first. The most challenging part was when we disassembled the PC, and we needed to remember all the steps to assemble the PC back. From here, I learnt that planning skills were crucial in order to install the component and each component from motherboard to RAM required cautious installation and connection. In all, this lab session emphasised the importance of teamwork and collaboration between the group members. It was also insightful experience that provide me with wonderful experiences.
